SUMMARY

	My wide-ranging work experience has taught me to multi-task, respect deadlines, and have the compassion needed to provide great customer service. For most of my career I have worked in a team environment and pride myself on being a team player. I'm a great listener and detail oriented person. This helps me get to the root of issues and identify next steps.
