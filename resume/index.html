      <h1 class="p2 text-thin text-uppercase" id="part2">Part 2: Tell us about yourself</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 q1">
      <h3>Where are you located?</h3>
      <p>I was born and raised in Madison, WI and currently live just south of Madison in Oregon, WI. I have also lived in Golden, CO for a period of about 8 months.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 q2">
      <h3>Why are you looking for a new position?</h3>
      <p>I was recently laid off from my job with Charter Communications due to not making a move to the headquarters in St. Louis, MO. My wife has a job with the State of WI that she really loves. It was decided that I would leave the company and study web development since I have been learning that for the last 6 monthsand really love it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 q3">
      <h3>Can you summarize your remote work experience?</h3>
      <p>My job with Charter was in a local office however, the team that I worked with was in St. Louis and I also had the ability to work from home when needed. All communication was done through email, and Microsoft Lync. If needed I would pick up the phone to get the answer quickly or to discuss anything that would be better suited to be done via phone than email or chat.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!--Second Row Of Questions-->
  <div class="row row2">
    <div class="col-sm-4 q4">
      <h3>What should we definitely look at in your resume/work experience?</h3>
      <p>My years of customer service speaks volumes for what I am able to achieve. I have had great success working with all types of people and have the ability to deal calmly with tough customers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 q5">
      <h3>What’s not on your resume/work experience but you think we should know?</h3>
      <p>I may lack the years of experience with web languages, however I have the drive to succeed. I am enrolled in online classes through Codecademy and Free Code Camp, as well as having worked through Chingu Cohort doing pair coding. I have made the full switch to Linux instead of dual-booting and am forcing myself to learn the command line and git versus using any type of git GUI.</p>
      <p>Due to me studying from home I have implemented the Pomodoro technique and find that I am a lot more focused. It is especially helpful when I open up the text editor. Without it I find that I will sit here for hours without a break just coding away. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 q6">
      <h3>Can you summarize your HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge?</h3>
      <p>I have worked through Codecademy HTML/CSS, and jQuery. I am currently finishing up Sass at this moment and plan to move on to JavaScript. I have had more trouble with JS than any of the other languages and really love working with HTML/CSS, jQuery and Sass. I am also reading about WordPress and WooCommerce and working on any examples that I can.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-3 q7">
      <h3>Why do you think you’re a good fit for this role?</h3>
      <p>As someone who has excellent customer experience and is eager to learning more about web development and WordPress knowledge I would be a great fit. I have the drive to succeed and to keep learning.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-3 q8">
      <h3>Anything else we should know about you?</h3>
      <p>Outside of coding I enjoy watching my kids play hockey, lacrosse, and football. I like playing a little hockey myself when I can. To unwind, I like sitting on my back porch reading, listening music or podcasts. Living out in the country, it is easy to relax with the sounds of nature to keep you calm.</p>

      <h2>Pre-Sales</h2>
      <p class="question">Imagine a potential customer emails you with the following question.
      <q> I’m considering switching to Product Customizer. Does your app allow live image previews? </q>
      We don’t yet offer this feature, but their current solution does. How would you respond?
      </p>
      <p>Customer,<br>
        Unfortunately at this time we do not support live image previews. This is something that I would be happy to bring to our engineers and see what options we have to implement this feature. In the meantime here are some options you have as a work around.
        <ul>
          <li>Option 1</li>
          <li>Option 2</li>
          <li>Option 3</li>
        </ul>
        Directions for each option can be found at <a href="http://www.example.com">HERE</a>. Please do not hesitate to reach out to our support staff with any other questions or concerns you may have.<br>

      <h2>Fire Alarm</h2>
      <p class="question">Imagine you’ve just started your workday. You login and see a large number of emails from distraught customers. Clearly, something is happening. What steps do you take?</p>
      <p>
        To start I would do a search for all email in the chain and see what information I could get from the last email in the chain. I would do a thorough scan of the email to see what steps have already been taken and what solutions, if any, have already been presented.<br>
        If it is still an ongoing issue I would contact the team member who last touched the issue to get a more in depth understanding of what is going and what steps have taken place to resolve the issue.

      <h2>Step-by-Step</h2>
      <p class="question">We’d like to get an idea of how you explain concepts and processes. What was the last thing your purchased online? Tell us, step-by-step, how you went about searching, choosing, and completing your purchase.</p>
      <p>Recently I had to purchase some parts for my dishwasher to keep the top rack from falling whenever it was pulled out. Below are the steps that it took to be able to find and purchase the needed parts.
      <ol>
        <li>Find the serial and model number of the dishwasher. This was located on the inside portion of the door on the left hand side.</li>
        <li>I took a photo of the model number tag and then searched online at the Kitchenaid website for manuals for the specific dishwasher I had.</li>
        <li>Once I found the manuals I downloaded the parts list for my dishwasher and looked through the pdf file to find the parts I needed. This was easy due to the drawings through out the manual that had numbers for each specific part.</li>
        <li>I found that number of the needed part, then cross referenced that number with the part number list.</li>
        <li>Once the part number was found I did a search on Amazon for Kitchenaid dishwasher parts using the specific model for the needed part. An example of my search is Kitchenaid W10195336 mount wheel which brought up a whirlpool part that was cpompatible with my disherwasher.</li>
